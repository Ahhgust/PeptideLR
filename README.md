#

peptideLR.py can be used to estimate a semicontinuous likelihood ratio from peptide alleles. <br>
It is designed based on [LoComatioN](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.04.016) of Gill et al., 
which in turn is based on the set theoretic (semicontinuous) likelihood ratio as per [Curran et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.04.077) <br>
